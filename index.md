# Webinar presentation ICTICT424 17 May 2021 #

This presentation relates to the cybersecurity standards and legislation businesses would need to follow to be fully compliant and to substancially reduce their risk of a successful or substancially successful cyber attack.

The standards and legislation covered in this webinar are:

The Australian Cyber Security Centre's (ACSC) [Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents](https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/publications/strategies-mitigate-cyber-security-incidents).

The [Australian Government Information Security Manual (ISM)](https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/ism).

The Notifiable Data Breach (NDB) Scheme, [data breach preparation and response](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/guidance-and-advice/data-breach-preparation-and-response/) guidence and response page.

The [Privacy Act 1988](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/the-privacy-act/).


## Assessment Event 1 ##

### Question 1 ###

Describe common threats and risks to the organisation with respect to the use of BYOD. Provide links or references.

This question is easily answered using the Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents framework.

For example;

By reviewing the strategies detailed in the table Strategies to mitigate cyber security incidents table, risks can be ascetained.

What risk are these strategies trying to stop;

1. Using application control to stop the execution of unknown or unsafe software on the BYOD devices?
2. Appling software patches, particulary those catergorised as high risk, within 48 hours on the BYOD devices?
3. Using web content filtering on BYOD devices?
4. Using antivirus on BYOD devices?
5. Ensuring antivirus software is functioning and up-to-date

### Question 3 ###

Refer to https://blog.netwrix.com/2018/02/01/top-20-critical-security-controls-for-effective-cyber-defense/ and identify some common cyber security controls as described by the Center for Internet Security (CIS), then research and detail their key features, and their associated advantages and disadvantages. 

Even though this question provides a link I would suggest going striaght to the source, [The 20 CIS Controls & Resources](https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/cis-controls-list/) and review the controls there.

Many of the controls listed in The 20 CIS Controls and Resources can be directly mapped to the Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents.

For example:

3. Continuous Vulnerability Management maps to Continuous incident detection and response.
 
4. Controlled Use of Administrative Privileges maps to Restrict administrative privileges.

5. Secure Configuration for Hardware and Software on Mobile Devices, Laptops, Workstations and Servers maps to Server application hardening and Operating system hardening.

### Question 6 ###

Compare 2 examples of cybersecurity testing procedures and their processes? (150-200 words). Provide links or references.

This question is covered by the Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents under Hunt to discover incidents section and from the Information Security Manual (ISM) [Continuous monitoring plan](https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/guidance/system-specific-security-documentation).
