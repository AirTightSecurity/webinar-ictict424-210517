# Webinar presentation ICTICT424 17 May 2021 #

This presentation relates to the cybersecurity standards and legislation businesses would need to follow to be fully compliant and to substantially reduce their risk of a successful cyber attack.

The standards and legislation covered in this webinar are:

The Australian Cyber Security Centre's (ACSC) [Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents](https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/publications/strategies-mitigate-cyber-security-incidents).

The [Australian Government Information Security Manual (ISM)](https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/ism).

The Notifiable Data Breach (NDB) Scheme, [data breach preparation and response](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/guidance-and-advice/data-breach-preparation-and-response/) guidence and response page.

The [Privacy Act 1988](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/the-privacy-act/).

The [Information security in general practice](https://www.racgp.org.au/running-a-practice/security/protecting-your-practice-information/information-security-in-general-practice/introduction).


## Assessment Event 1 ##

### Question 1 ###

Describe common threats and risks to the organisation with respect to the use of BYOD. Provide links or references.

This question is easily answered using the Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents framework.

For example;

By reviewing the strategies detailed in the table Strategies to mitigate cybersecurity incidents table, risks can be ascertained.

What risk are these strategies trying to stop;

1. Using application control to stop the execution of unknown or unsafe software on the BYOD devices?
2. Appling software patches, particularly those categorised as high risk, within 48 hours on the BYOD devices?
3. Using web content filtering on BYOD devices?
4. Using antivirus on BYOD devices?
5. Ensuring antivirus software is functioning and up-to-date

The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) also publishes this guide that states are the reasonable steps all entities covered by the Privacy Act 1988 are required to take. See the [Guide to securing personal information](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/guidance-and-advice/guide-to-securing-personal-information) and in particular [Part B — Steps and strategies which may be reasonable to take - ICT security](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/guidance-and-advice/guide-to-securing-personal-information/#ict-security).


### Question 3 ###

Refer to https://blog.netwrix.com/2018/02/01/top-20-critical-security-controls-for-effective-cyber-defense/ and identify some common cybersecurity controls as described by the Center for Internet Security (CIS), then research and detail their key features and associated advantages and disadvantages. 

Even though this question provides a URL I would suggest going straight to the source, [The 20 CIS Controls & Resources](https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/cis-controls-list/) and review the most update to date controls there.

Many of the controls listed in The 20 CIS Controls and Resources can be directly mapped to the Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents.

For example:

3. Continuous Vulnerability Management maps to "Continuous incident detection and response".
 
4. Controlled Use of Administrative Privileges maps to "Restrict administrative privileges".

5. Secure Configuration for Hardware and Software on Mobile Devices, Laptops, Workstations and Servers maps to "Server application hardening" and "Operating system hardening".


### Question 6 ###

Compare 2 examples of cybersecurity testing procedures and their processes? (150-200 words). Provide links or references.

This question is covered by the Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents under "Hunt to discover incidents" section or penetration testing and from the Information Security Manual (ISM) "[Continuous monitoring plan](https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/guidance/system-specific-security-documentation)" or vulnerability scanning.

The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) in their [Guide to securing personal information](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/guidance-and-advice/guide-to-securing-personal-information) and in particular [Part B — Steps and strategies which may be reasonable to take - ICT security](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/guidance-and-advice/guide-to-securing-personal-information/#ict-security) under the heading Testing also mentions penetration and vulnerability testing.


### Question 7 ###

What are some common frameworks for conducting cybersecurity threat and risk assessment and what are their commonalities and differences?  (150-200 words). Provide links or references.

This webinar discusses several frameworks (the list on the top of this page) that can be used to answer this question.


## Assessment Event 2 ##

### Part 2 Question 1 Table 2 ###

The first part of the presented table requires the valuable assets of the orgnaisation are recorded.

Undertaking an asset audit and creating an asset register is commonplace in most standards. It could be considered a corner stone of security as a device can not be secured if it is unknown to the organisation or the people who are tasked to secure it.

This is covered in the Information Security Manual (ISM) [ICT equipment and media register](https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/guidance/ict-equipment-and-media).

### Part 2 Question 2a ###

The [Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents](https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/publications/strategies-mitigate-cyber-security-incidents) can be used to list the threats and risks of all the assets listed in the assets register.

Note, review the Unit FAQ for the specific devices to be included in the table. Click here to download the [ICTICT424 Unit FAQ](https://share.tafensw.edu.au/share/file/a7edc480-a319-49c6-9646-76cbc8c8a5a5/1/ICTICT424%20Unit%20FAQ%20v1.pdf).

Some examples are;

A desktop is vulnerable to viruses and being compromised through email or browser attacks if the sections are not implemented:

1. Configure Microsoft Office macro settings.
2. User application hardening.
3. Email content filtering.
4. Web content filtering.
5. Operating system hardening.

Another example that can be considered for all devices (so desktops, servers, mobile devices, network shares, etc) is encryption.

Encryption is covered in the OAIC Guide to securing personal information - [Part B — Steps and strategies which may be reasonable to take - ICT security](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/guidance-and-advice/guide-to-securing-personal-information/#ict-security). It is also mentioned in the Information Security Manual (ISM) [Mobile device management](https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/guidance/mobile-device-management).


### Part 2 Question 5 ###

Although this is covered in some fashion in the Information Security Manual (ISM) [Mobile device management](https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/guidance/mobile-device-management) section the Center for Internet Security's (CIS) has released the [CIS Controls™ Mobile Companion Guide](https://www.cisecurity.org/blog/new-release-cis-controls-mobile-companion-guide/) which provides a very detailed and easy to review checklist of controls on page 13 of the guide.


### Part 2 Question 8 ###

This question directly relates to what is mandated in Australaia by the Notifiable Data Breach (NDB) Scheme and the Privacy Act (1988) if an organisation is compromised by a data breach.

Does the organisation in question have to adhere to the NDB and the Privacy Act (1988)?

There are many large organisations that must adhere to the NDB scheme but many small and medium sized businesses have to adhere to the NDB too, if they meet (among others) the following case:

1. hold health information and provides a health service

Or undertake the (among others) following activities;

1. operate a residential tenancy database

There are a few other cases and activities but none that would relate to most small to medium sized businesses. Review the full list in Part 4: Notifiable Data Breach (NDB) Scheme [Entities covered by the NDB scheme - Small business operators](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/guidance-and-advice/data-breach-preparation-and-response/part-4-notifiable-data-breach-ndb-scheme/#small-business-operators).
